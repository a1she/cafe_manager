☕ Cafe Manager Game: README Essentials
Project Title and Description
Cafe Manager is a terminal-based resource management game. Your goal is to earn 20 points by strategically managing ingredients and serving customer orders. Points are gained by serving and lost by skipping customers.

Installation Instructions
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/a1she/cafe_manager.git

Run the program: Execute the game through the main file.

Usage and Examples
Play is conducted entirely within the terminal by responding to prompts with correct inputs. To strategize, view recipes in the resources text file. Be cautious: selecting "Serve next customer" processes all waiting customers therefore food must be made before serving; if you select 'N' when prompted to serve a customer, your points will be reduced.
